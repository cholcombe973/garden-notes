Sept 1st - I made apple butter and I noticed the barlett pears were turning yellow.  Time to pick them.
The fuji apples are just starting to turn red.
I extended the drip irrigation line to include the strawberries and created a 3rd zone to take
care of the currents along the east side of the house.
