Leaves are turning yellow on figs and persimmions.  The trees are ready
to wrap it up for the year.  
The smaller apple tree apples still aren't ripe.  They're clinging pretty
hard to the tree.
I pruned the bartlett pear pretty hard.  I'm trying to make it look more
like a natural tree with a central leader.

I planted more garlic cloves around the small golden gem apple tree.
I repotted the green tea seedlings into soil from under the pine tree.
I should have the cinnamon vine seeds I got from japan planted up soon.
