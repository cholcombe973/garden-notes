Harvested the first black spanish fig.  It was great!  Moist, hints of honey.
Made blue elderberry syrup for pancakes again.  Just to be on the safe side
strain the seeds out next time.  I thought I poisoned myself by accient briefly.
Turns out it was just me being tired but it's better to be safe than sorry.
